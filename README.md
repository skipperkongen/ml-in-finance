My notes for the Udacity course [Machine Learning for Trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-for-trading--ud501).

Important stats:

- Daily returns
    - for multiple stocks
    - histograms: mean, std, kurtosis
    - alpha
    - scatter plots
- Bolling bands (debatable)

Portfolio metrics:

- Cumulative return
- Average daily return vs. risk-free daily return
- Risk (std. of daily returns)
- Sharpe ratio

> Usually, any Sharpe ratio greater than 1 is considered acceptable to good by investors. A ratio higher than 2 is rated as very good, and a ratio of 3 or higher is considered excellent.
